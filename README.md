# Tutorial Title

## Introduction
Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.
A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes
for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It
allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version
(each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful
metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular
project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be
kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration
among different people.

KeyPoints:
1. Version control is like an unlimited ‘undo’.
2. Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.


## Prerequisites
In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell is expected, but isn’t mandatory.
